# HKN UCSD emails
### Author: Lucas Tindall


## [Templates](templates)
This directory has templates for different types of emails sent out by HKN
officers. 
+ [newsletter](tempaltes/newsletter_template.html)

+ [single event](templates/single_event_template.html)

+ [induction invitation](templates/induction_template.html)


## [Examples](examples)
Contains actual emails from 2016-2017. 


## Notes from Lucas
I usually made the emails by manually moving sections from a
google doc over to the needed template. I would just make a copy of an old
email and replace/delete the relevant info by editing the html in a text editor. 
This was not a very efficient process but it worked. 

If you then view the local html file in a browser you can select all, copy,
and paste into gmail. 

Things to watch out for: 
+ send a test email and view on multiple devices; sometimes the html/css can
  get messed up and create unforseen problems

## tldr
+ create copy of template 
+ open copy in text editor
+ copy/paste new text
+ open html in browser
+ copy/paste into gmail
+ send test email

## Suggestions for future
Write some kind of app/script that will allow someone to select a type of email
they want to create and prompt them for the relevant info. The app/script would
then auto-generate the email instead of someone having to manually copy/paste
each time.
